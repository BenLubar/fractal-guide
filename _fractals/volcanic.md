# Volcanic

## Grawl Guards

### Things to remember while fighting the grawl guards

- Some players will skip the cutscene and some may not. Try not to attract the guards' attention until multiple players are ready to help you.
- Although you can jump onto the cliff to your right, there is no tactical advantage to fighting the grawl guards there.
- There are a LOT of grawl guards. Avoid being too far away from your team.

## Tunnel

### Things to remember while traversing the tunnel

- Do not touch the flaming boulders. If a friend touches one, it is best to leave them to die instead of risking also dying.
- Only one player needs to successfully make it to the end of the tunnel. Once the boss is alerted, everyone who has not made it there yet can [forfeit](/mechanics/forfeit.html) and respawn in a safe spot the end of the tunnel.
- Since the boulders alternate sides, the boulders' flaming trails are one of the safest places to be in the tunnel, assuming you can tank the burning damage.

## Grawl Shaman

### Things to remember while fighting the grawl shaman

#### Bubble phase

- Do not allow the grawl to throw the people off the cliff. Not only is this mean, it also prevents you from getting the bonus reward.
- If all four humans are thrown off the cliff, your party will fail the encounter.
- Use [crowd control](/mechanics/crowd-control.html) to slow down the grawl, but make sure you use forced-movement effects like knockbacks, launches, and fear *away* from the humans.
- Make sure you are within range when you throw the boulder. In action camera mode, the crosshair will be orientde like + instead of &times;. Otherwise, check the bottom of the "throw boulder" skill for a red bar. If the red bar is there, move closer or your boulder will not hit the shaman.

#### Burn phase

- The shaman may summon a totem. The totem will reduce the damage the shaman takes and increase the shaman's critical hit chance, but it may be better to leave the totem alone if your party has a member capable of corrupting these boons.
- If the shaman enters a bubble, it can only be broken by a stone like during the original bubble phase. The bubble in this case only has one charge, so only one player needs to grab a stone.
- If you see a scary orange circle on the floor around the shaman, move out of the circle until it disappears.

## Mineshaft

### Things to remember while traversing the mineshaft

- Occasionally, you will be in a party with someone crazy enough to jump off the same cliff the shaman just jumped off and swim through the lava to the island. If this happens, or if someone reaches the end of the mineshaft long before you do, you can [forfeit](/mechanics/forfeit.html) to save time.
- Don't fight any enemies in the mineshaft if you can avoid it. The bats will not follow you off cliffs, and they are all located near cliffs.
- In the first room, when going to the lower platform, do not jump. Instead, walk off the edge. This will cause your momentum to be low enough that you do not take falling damage.
- The easiest route through the second room is along the right wall, past the skeleton sitting by a chest. You cannot open the chest.

## Imbued Shaman

### Things to remember while fighting the imbued shaman

- While you are on the island, unless you are constantly moving, you will be set on fire.
- Avoid the indentations in the island's surface. These can fill with lava unexpectedly, which can hurt.
- If the shaman shoots a firey projectile, avoid being hit by it. If you are hit, you will repeatedly explode. If this happens, avoid standing near your team.
- If the shaman flies into the air, dodge while he dives to avoid a large amount of damage.
- If you see an even scarier scary orange circle on the floor around the shaman, move out of the circle until it disappears.
- At 75%, 50%, and 25% health, the shaman will summon a shield bubble and start moving towards one of the human captives at the edges of the island.
  - To avoid having no time to react, make sure the shaman is located near the center of the island.
  - If the shaman reaches a captive, it will regain 25% of its health. However, it will not trigger the bubble again until the *next* health threshold.
  - If your team has important spells that are still on cooldown, it may be worth waiting for those spells to recharge instead of damaging the shaman.
  - The bubble takes 40 hits to destroy. This has a short cooldown per-player, so attacks that hit multiple times simultaneously will still only remove one charge from the bubble.
  - When the shaman summons the bubble, several lava elementals will also appear. Killing these is important as they will deal a lot of damage. If you go down during this phase, target a lava elemental and attack it in downed state so that your team can cause you to rally by helping you finish it off.
